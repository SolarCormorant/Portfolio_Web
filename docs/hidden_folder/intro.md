- The goal of the algorithm is to drastically reduce the time spent on design, allowing explore the design options faster, deliver a fully functional staircase to the customer within minutes.
- It provides a user-friendly interface that can be used by anyone,  eliminating the barrier of entry and streamlining the workflow. 
- The algorithm automates **80% of the work**, allowing designers to focus on the creative and project-specific 20%.
- I know there are few existing algorithm to create stairs but this one allows to create designs of all (as far as I know) possibilities

## Features
- **Dynamic UI:** Inputs and constraints adapt automatically to the current design, reducing setup time and preventing invalid configurations.
- **BIMesque Data Flow:** Every element carries structured information (e.g., material, weight, cost), enabling seamless data integration and informed decision-making.
- **Flexible Customization:** Designs remain fully editable at any stage through direct interaction with Rhino, allowing rapid iterations without breaking the workflow.
- **Manufacturing-Ready Output:** The algorithm generates detailed, production-ready geometry, minimizing post-processing and ensuring a direct path from design to fabrication.
    
- The algorithm is fully modular, with all functionality clustered and organized through Hops. This structure keeps the definition clean, simplifies debugging, and makes it easier to maintain or extend the workflow.
    
- In addition to the 3D parametric model, the algorithm generates 2D outputs such as plans, exploded step views, and shop drawings, streamlining documentation and supporting manufacturing workflows.



## Why It Matters

Traditional stair design workflows are slow, repetitive, and often require specialized expertise. By automating the majority of the process and ensuring compatibility across designs, this algorithm bridges the gap between speed and flexibility â€” empowering teams to deliver accurate results faster, explore more alternatives, and maintain full control over the outcome.
